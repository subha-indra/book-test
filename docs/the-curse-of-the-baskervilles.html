<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> The Curse of the Baskervilles</h1>
<p>“I have in my pocket a manuscript,” said Dr. James Mortimer.</p>
<p>“I observed it as you entered the room,” said Holmes.</p>
<p>“It is an old manuscript.”</p>
<p>“Early eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.”</p>
<p>“How can you say that, sir?”</p>
<p>“You have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all
the time that you have been talking. It would be a poor expert
who could not give the date of a document within a decade or so.
You may possibly have read my little monograph upon the subject.
I put that at 1730.”</p>
<p>“The exact date is 1742.” Dr. Mortimer drew it from his
breast-pocket. “This family paper was committed to my care by Sir
Charles Baskerville, whose sudden and tragic death some three
months ago created so much excitement in Devonshire. I may say
that I was his personal friend as well as his medical attendant.
He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd, practical, and as
unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this document very
seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end as did
eventually overtake him.”</p>
<p>Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it
upon his knee. “You will observe, Watson, the alternative use of
the long <em>s</em> and the short. It is one of several indications
which enabled me to fix the date.”</p>
<p>I looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded
script. At the head was written: “Baskerville Hall,” and below in
large, scrawling figures: “1742.”</p>
<p>“It appears to be a statement of some sort.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is a statement of a certain legend which runs in the
Baskerville family.”</p>
<p>“But I understand that it is something more modern and practical
upon which you wish to consult me?”</p>
<p>“Most modern. A most practical, pressing matter, which must be
decided within twenty-four hours. But the manuscript is short and
is intimately connected with the affair. With your permission I
will read it to you.”</p>
<p>Holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together,
and closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. Dr. Mortimer
turned the manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking
voice the following curious, old-world narrative:</p>
<p>“Of the origin of the Hound of the Baskervilles there have been
many statements, yet as I come in a direct line from Hugo
Baskerville, and as I had the story from my father, who also
had it from his, I have set it down with all belief that it
occurred even as is here set forth. And I would have you
believe, my sons, that the same Justice which punishes sin may
also most graciously forgive it, and that no ban is so heavy
but that by prayer and repentance it may be removed. Learn
then from this story not to fear the fruits of the past, but
rather to be circumspect in the future, that those foul
passions whereby our family has suffered so grievously may not
again be loosed to our undoing.</p>
<p>“Know then that in the time of the Great Rebellion (the
history of which by the learned Lord Clarendon I most
earnestly commend to your attention) this Manor of
Baskerville was held by Hugo of that name, nor can it be
gainsaid that he was a most wild, profane, and godless man.
This, in truth, his neighbours might have pardoned, seeing
that saints have never flourished in those parts, but there
was in him a certain wanton and cruel humour which made his
name a by-word through the West. It chanced that this Hugo
came to love (if, indeed, so dark a passion may be known
under so bright a name) the daughter of a yeoman who held
lands near the Baskerville estate. But the young maiden,
being discreet and of good repute, would ever avoid him,
for she feared his evil name. So it came to pass that one
Michaelmas this Hugo, with five or six of his idle and
wicked companions, stole down upon the farm and carried off
the maiden, her father and brothers being from home, as he
well knew. When they had brought her to the Hall the
maiden was placed in an upper chamber, while Hugo and his
friends sat down to a long carouse, as was their nightly
custom. Now, the poor lass upstairs was like to have her
wits turned at the singing and shouting and terrible oaths
which came up to her from below, for they say that the
words used by Hugo Baskerville, when he was in wine, were
such as might blast the man who said them. At last in the
stress of her fear she did that which might have daunted
the bravest or most active man, for by the aid of the
growth of ivy which covered (and still covers) the south
wall she came down from under the eaves, and so homeward
across the moor, there being three leagues betwixt the Hall
and her father’s farm.</p>
<p>“It chanced that some little time later Hugo left his
guests to carry food and drink—with other worse things,
perchance—to his captive, and so found the cage empty and
the bird escaped. Then, as it would seem, he became as one
that hath a devil, for, rushing down the stairs into the
dining-hall, he sprang upon the great table, flagons and
trenchers flying before him, and he cried aloud before all
the company that he would that very night render his body
and soul to the Powers of Evil if he might but overtake the
wench. And while the revellers stood aghast at the fury of
the man, one more wicked or, it may be, more drunken than
the rest, cried out that they should put the hounds upon
her. Whereat Hugo ran from the house, crying to his grooms
that they should saddle his mare and unkennel the pack, and
giving the hounds a kerchief of the maid’s, he swung them
to the line, and so off full cry in the moonlight over the
moor.</p>
